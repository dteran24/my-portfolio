        I love to build new things and constantly working to improve and learn
        new technologies. It is a great satisfaction being able to add new
        features to projects or even fixing a bug that took 4 hours to find (we
        all have been there). I have worked with and even lead teams in my past
        work experiences. I work well with others and easily adaptable. I am
        interested in contributing as well as learning from an established team.
